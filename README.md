Chap’s challenge is a creative clone of the (first level of the) 1989 Atari game Chips Challenge. To learn more about Chip’s Challenge, please read the Wikipedia article, watch a playthrough on youtube, or even try to get hold of the actual game (there are some free browser-based versions, and it is available on Steam). In Chips Challenge, an actor moves through a maze directed by the keystrokes of the user, collects treasures and searches for the exit that leads to the next level.

We have been given permission by Chuck Summerville, the developer of CC, to reimplement this game. Thank you Chuck !
